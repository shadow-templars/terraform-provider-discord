# Community servers

Use [`discord_community`](../resources/community.md) to enable and configure Community features. Creating the resource enables Community; destroying it disables Community.

## Prerequisites and lifecycle

Set `verification_level >= 1` and `explicit_content_filter = 2` through `discord_managed_server` before enabling Community. The rules channel must be viewable by @everyone; a role-restricted channel is recommended for administrator updates and safety alerts.

Disabling Community also affects features that depend on it, including onboarding and announcement channels. Use `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` if Community must remain enabled.

## Ownership

- Server description belongs to `discord_managed_server`.
- Membership Screening is not managed by this provider.
- Age restriction (`nsfw_level`) cannot be set through the resource.

See the [Community example](https://github.com/shadow-templars/terraform-provider-discord/tree/main/examples/resources/discord_community/resource.tf) for configuration and dependencies.
